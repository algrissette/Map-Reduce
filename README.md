# Map-Reduce

## Overview
This project implements a MapReduce framework in Go, a powerful pattern for processing and generating large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster. MapReduce is commonly used in big data processing and analytics tasks.

## Features
- **Map Function**: Breaks down the input data into key-value pairs.
- **Reduce Function**: Aggregates and processes the intermediate key-value pairs produced by the Map phase.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes goroutines and channels to enable concurrent execution of map and reduce tasks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles failures and retries tasks automatically to ensure fault tolerance.
- **Scalability**: Scales efficiently to process large datasets across multiple nodes in a cluster.

## Setup
1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).
2. **Download Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Getting Started
1. **Define Map and Reduce Functions**: Implement custom map and reduce functions based on your data processing requirements. These functions should adhere to the MapReduce interface.
2. **Prepare Input Data**: Organize your input data into a format suitable for processing by the map function. This could involve splitting the data into smaller chunks or formatting it as key-value pairs.
3. **Run MapReduce Job**: Execute the MapReduce job by providing the input data, map function, reduce function, and any other necessary configuration parameters.
4. **Monitor Progress**: Monitor the progress of the MapReduce job and analyze the output data generated by the reduce function.
